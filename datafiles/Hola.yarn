Hola: Oh! You startled me... I didn't expect anyone else here.
    -> Are you alright?
        Hola: I... I think so? Everything is so chaotic and I'm afraid to... to use my magic.
        <<jump Afraid>>
    -> Can you help me fight?
        Hola: Fight? I... what if I hurt someone? What if I can't control it?
        <<jump Afraid>>
    -> You're safe now
        Hola: Am I? I want to believe that... but my power, it's so strong. Too strong.
        <<jump Afraid>>
    -> Carry the torch for me <<if $hola_recruited and $torch_carrier != $hola_id>>
        <<companion_take_torch()>>
        <<if $hola_recruited and $torch_carrier == $hola_id>>
            Hola: I-I'll hold it steady. Just stay close so I know you're safe.
        <<else>>
            Hola: I don't think I can manage that right now... maybe when you're ready again?
        <<endif>>
        <<jump Start>>
    -> Could you give the torch back? <<if $hola_recruited and $torch_carrier == $hola_id>>
        <<companion_stop_carrying_torch()>>
        <<if $vn_torch_transfer_success>>
            Hola: Here--careful, it's still warm. You're better at keeping everyone calm than I am.
        <<else>>
            Hola: Oh! Your hand's full. Let me keep it until you're ready, alright?
        <<endif>>
        <<jump Start>>
    -> Join me, I'll keep you safe <<if $hola_recruited == false>>
        Hola: You would... protect me? Even knowing what I might do?
        <<jump Recruit>>
    -> I should go
        Hola: Oh... yes, of course. Be careful out there.
        <<jump Exit>>

Hola: The All blessed me with wind magic, but... what if I'm not worthy? What if I make everything worse?
    -> You're stronger than you think
        Hola: Do you really think so? I... I want to believe you.
        <<jump Start>>
    -> We all have doubts
        Hola: Yes... yes, I suppose that's true. Thank you for understanding.
        <<jump Start>>
    -> Join me, we'll face it together <<if $hola_recruited == false>>
        Hola: Together? You would trust me, even with my fears?
