  - [x] 5.2 Modify obj_player/Collision_obj_enemy_parent.gml to use get_damage_modifier()
  - [x] 5.3 Add immunity check before damage calculation (if has_immunity, damage = 0)
  - [x] 5.4 Test damage calculation with no traits (should be 1.0x modifier)
  - [x] 5.5 Test damage calculation with 1 stack resistance (should be 0.75x modifier)

- [x] 6. Implement Opposite Trait Cancellation
  - [x] 6.1 Test resistance (3 stacks) + vulnerability (2 stacks) = net resistance (1 stack)
  - [x] 6.2 Test resistance (2 stacks) + vulnerability (3 stacks) = net vulnerability (1 stack)
  - [x] 6.3 Test resistance (2 stacks) + vulnerability (2 stacks) = net 0 stacks (neutral damage)
  - [x] 6.4 Test immunity (1 stack) + vulnerability (2 stacks) = net vulnerability (1 stack)
  - [x] 6.5 Test immunity (2 stacks) + vulnerability (1 stack) = net immunity (1 stack)
  - [x] 6.6 Verify cancellation works for all resistance/vulnerability pairs

- [x] 7. Add Debug Commands for Trait Testing
  - [x] 7.1 Add keyboard input handling for trait debug commands (T/Y/U/I/O/P keys)
  - [x] 7.2 Implement T key to add 1 stack of fire_resistance to player (permanent)
  - [x] 7.3 Implement Y key to add 1 stack of fire_vulnerability to player (temporary)
  - [x] 7.4 Implement U key to clear all temporary traits from player
  - [x] 7.5 Implement I key to show debug message with all permanent and temporary trait stacks
  - [x] 7.6 Implement O key to apply "fireborne" tag to nearest enemy
  - [x] 7.7 Implement P key to show net trait stacks after cancellation for all traits
  - [x] 7.8 Test all debug commands in-game and verify stack counts

- [x] 8. Create Test Enemies with Tags and Verify Integration
  - [x] 8.1 Create test enemy with tags = ["fireborne"] and verify fire_immunity, ice_vulnerability, fire_aura traits
  - [x] 8.2 Create test enemy with tags = ["arboreal"] and verify fire_vulnerability (2), poison_resistance (1), nature_affinity (1)
  - [x] 8.3 Test fire damage (100) against fireborne enemy (should deal 0 damage due to immunity)
  - [x] 8.4 Test ice damage (100) against fireborne enemy (should deal 150 damage due to vulnerability)
  - [x] 8.5 Test fire damage (100) against arboreal enemy (should deal 225 damage due to 2 vulnerability stacks: 1.5Â²)
  - [x] 8.6 Test physical damage (100) against various trait combinations (should deal 100 damage if no physical traits)
  - [x] 8.7 Equip fire resistance item, gain 1 temporary trait stack, verify damage reduction stacks with permanent traits
  - [x] 8.8 Unequip item, verify temporary trait stack is removed
  - [x] 8.9 Test complex scenario: enemy with fire_resistance (3) hit by weapon that applies fire_vulnerability (2), verify net 1 resistance
  - [x] 8.10 Document any discovered issues or edge cases

- [x] 9. Verify Tag System Integration
  - [x] 9.1 Test apply_tag("fireborne") correctly grants fire_immunity (1), ice_vulnerability (1), fire_aura (1)
  - [x] 9.2 Test applying multiple tags to same character stacks traits correctly (e.g., "fireborne" + "salamander" both grant fire traits)
  - [x] 9.3 Verify tags array is properly stored and can be inspected for UI/debug purposes
  - [x] 9.4 Test enemy creation pattern: set tags in Create, call apply_tag() for each tag
  - [x] 9.5 Verify tag-granted traits persist throughout enemy lifecycle

Follow TDD principles where applicable, considering this is a GameMaker project without formal unit testing infrastructure. Manual testing steps are critical for verification, especially for stacking and cancellation mechanics.
