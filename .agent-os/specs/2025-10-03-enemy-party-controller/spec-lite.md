# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement an enemy party controller system that coordinates groups of enemies through formation templates, shared state machines, and weighted decision-making (attack/formation/flee). Parties adapt their tactics based on survival percentage, player HP, and party composition, while integrating with existing grid-based pathfinding for strategic positioning.
