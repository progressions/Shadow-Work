# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement automatic VN intro system that triggers when characters/objects first enter camera view. System pans camera to spotlight the character, opens VN dialogue with configurable yarn file/node, tracks seen flags to prevent re-triggering, and pans camera back to player on completion. Works with companions, enemies, bosses, and arbitrary trigger objects via per-instance configuration.
