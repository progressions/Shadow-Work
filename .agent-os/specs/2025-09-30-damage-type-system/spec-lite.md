# damage-type-system - Lite Summary

Add damage type categorization (physical, magical, fire, holy, unholy) to Shadow Work's combat system with a resistance/immunity system. This enables entities to be immune, resistant, or vulnerable to specific damage types, creating deeper combat strategy and visual feedback through color-coded damage numbers.

## Key Points
- Five damage types: physical, magical, fire, holy, unholy
- Resistance multipliers from 0.0 (immune) to 2.0 (weak), default 1.0 (normal)
- Color-coded floating damage numbers and "IMMUNE!" feedback for blocked damage
