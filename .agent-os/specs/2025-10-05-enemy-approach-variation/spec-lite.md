# Enemy Approach Variation - Lite Summary

Implement varied enemy approach patterns by adding randomized flanking behavior when enemies get within close range (100-150 pixels) of the player. Enemies have a 30-50% chance to select perpendicular approach angles (±90 degrees from direct path), circling to attack from above/below or left/right instead of straight-on. This prevents predictable combat and requires player repositioning.

## Key Points
- Enemies evaluate flanking behavior at close range (100-150 pixels)
- 30-50% chance to select perpendicular approach angles (±90 degrees)
- Creates dynamic combat requiring player repositioning
