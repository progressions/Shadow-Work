# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a ranged attack system for the player that allows firing arrows when equipped with bow weapons. When pressing J with a bow equipped and arrows in inventory, spawn an obj_arrow projectile that travels in cardinal directions at speed 6, dealing bow weapon damage to enemies on collision and destroying itself when hitting walls, enemies, or going offscreen. Player can move freely once the arrow fires.
