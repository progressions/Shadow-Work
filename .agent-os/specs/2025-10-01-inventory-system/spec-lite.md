# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a keyboard-navigable inventory screen with dual loadout system (melee/ranged), allowing players to manage 16-slot inventory, equip weapons and armor, and swap between combat stances using Q key. The system features four panels (character stats, paper doll, inventory grid, companions) with smart auto-equip logic that routes items to correct slots and handles two-handed weapons automatically.
