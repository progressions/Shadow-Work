# Complete Hola Companion Abilities - Lite Summary

Complete the implementation of Hola's three missing companion features: passive slowing aura (50% enemy slow within 120px), passive slipstream aura (20% dash cooldown reduction), and maelstrom deflection bonus (+25% deflection for 4s). These features establish Hola's identity as the battlefield control specialist and scale with affinity like all companion auras.

## Key Points
- Slowing aura creates 120px radius field that reduces enemy movement speed by 50% (affinity-scaled)
- Passive slipstream aura provides constant 20% dash cooldown reduction (stacks with active trigger)
- Maelstrom ultimate adds +25% deflection chance for 4 seconds on top of base Wind Deflection aura
