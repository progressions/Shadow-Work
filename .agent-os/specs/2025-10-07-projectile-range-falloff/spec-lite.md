# Spec Summary (Lite)

Add distance-based range profiles to projectile weapons so longbows reward long shots and crossbows excel up close. Projectiles store their spawn position, calculate a damage multiplier from the configured profile, and apply it before existing resistance and DR math. Designers adjust each weaponâ€™s profile through item stats with optional debug readouts for tuning.
