# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a memory and event system for enemy AI that allows them to perceive, remember, and react to significant world events like ally deaths and threats. Enemies within a perception radius can detect broadcast events, store them as time-limited memories, and use those memories to make tactical decisions like breaking morale when too many allies die or becoming cautious after witnessing major threats.
