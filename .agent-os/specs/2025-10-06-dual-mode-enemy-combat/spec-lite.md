# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement context-based attack mode switching for enemies, allowing them to intelligently choose between ranged and melee attacks based on player distance relative to their ideal_range threshold. Enemies above ideal_range use ranged attacks, while enemies below ideal_range switch to melee, with ranged-preferring enemies retreating to maintain optimal combat distance. Party formations influence mode selection, with rear positions favoring ranged combat and front positions favoring melee engagement.
