# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement dynamic affinity-based scaling for all companion passive auras, where effectiveness ranges from ~60% at affinity 3.0 to 300% (3x) at affinity 10.0 using a diminishing returns curve. Companions will start at affinity 3.0 by default, and all existing auras (regeneration, DR, etc.) will scale with affinity to reward relationship building.
