# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Save/Load Menu UI
> Created: 2025-10-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a save/load menu interface accessible from the pause menu, featuring a vertical list of save slots with a preview panel showing detailed information about the selected save. The interface will be built using the existing flexbox UI system and allow players to save and load games across multiple slots using WASD navigation.

## User Stories

### Accessing Save/Load Menu

As a player, I want to access the save/load menu from the pause menu, so that I can save my progress or load a previous save without exiting to the main menu.

When the player opens the pause menu and navigates to the save/load option, they are presented with a clean interface showing all available save slots in a vertical list on the left side, with detailed information about the currently selected save displayed in a preview panel on the right.

### Saving Game to Slot

As a player, I want to save my current game progress to a specific slot, so that I can preserve my progress and create multiple save files for different playthroughs or backup purposes.

When the player selects a save slot and chooses to save, the game writes all current state (player position, inventory, quest progress, companion states, etc.) to that slot. If the slot already contains a save, the player receives a confirmation prompt before overwriting. The save includes metadata like timestamp, location, playtime, and character level for easy identification.

### Loading Game from Slot

As a player, I want to load a previously saved game from a specific slot, so that I can continue my progress from where I left off or restart from an earlier point.

When the player selects a save slot containing valid data and chooses to load, the game restores all state from that save file, including player position, inventory, quest progress, and companion states. The player is returned to the exact location and condition they were in when that save was created.

### Managing Multiple Save Slots

As a player, I want to see clear information about each save slot (timestamp, location, playtime), so that I can easily identify and choose the correct save to load or overwrite.

The save slot list displays key information for each save: slot number, character name/level, current location, total playtime, and last saved timestamp. Empty slots are clearly marked as available. The preview panel shows additional details when a slot is selected, including a larger view of save statistics.

## Spec Scope

1. **Pause Menu Integration** - Add "Save/Load" option to pause menu that opens the save/load interface
2. **Save Slot List UI** - Create vertical scrollable list showing 6-8 save slots with metadata (slot number, character info, location, timestamp, playtime)
3. **Preview Panel UI** - Create detail panel showing expanded information for selected save slot
4. **WASD Navigation** - Implement keyboard navigation (W/S for slot selection, A/D for mode switching, Enter to confirm, ESC to cancel)
5. **Save Functionality** - Integrate with existing save system to write game state to selected slot with confirmation for overwrites
6. **Load Functionality** - Load game state from selected slot and transition player to saved location
7. **Auto-save Display** - Show auto-save slot separately or at top of list (read-only)
8. **Empty Slot Handling** - Display placeholder for empty slots and allow saving to them

## Out of Scope

- Screenshot thumbnails for save slots (can be added in future iteration)
- Cloud save synchronization
- Save file import/export functionality
- Save file deletion (can be added later if needed)
- Character equipment preview in save slot
- Multiple pages of save slots beyond initial 8-10 slots

## Expected Deliverable

1. Players can access save/load menu from pause menu with smooth UI transition
2. Players can navigate save slots using WASD, view detailed save information, and save/load games successfully
3. Save slot metadata (timestamp, location, playtime, character info) displays correctly and updates when saves are created
4. Existing save system integrates seamlessly with new UI, preserving all game state across save/load cycles
