# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a save/load menu interface accessible from the pause menu, featuring a vertical list of save slots with a preview panel showing detailed save information. Built using the existing flexbox UI system with WASD navigation, players can save and load games across multiple slots, with each save displaying metadata including timestamp, location, playtime, and character info for easy identification.
