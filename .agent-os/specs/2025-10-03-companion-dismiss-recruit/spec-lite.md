# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a companion dismissal and recruitment system that allows players to dismiss companions from their party, positioning them in the world where they can be recruited again later. This system includes full serialization of companion state (position, quest flags, dialogue flags, party status) for save/load functionality, ensuring dismissed companions persist at their exact location with all progress intact across game sessions.
