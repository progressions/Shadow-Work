# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a zero-performance-impact sound variant randomization system that automatically detects and randomly selects between sound file variations (snd_name_1, snd_name_2, snd_name_3) to prevent audio repetition fatigue. The system caches variant counts at game start and enhances the existing play_sfx() function to transparently select random variants while maintaining backward compatibility with non-variant sounds.
