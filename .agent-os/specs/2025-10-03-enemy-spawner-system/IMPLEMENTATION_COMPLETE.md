- Implemented finite spawn mode with spawn limits
- Added spawn sound effect support

### ✅ Task 3: Proximity Activation and Enemy Cap Management
- Implemented proximity detection system
- Added automatic activation/deactivation based on player distance

- Implemented damage handling
- Created collision event with obj_attack
- Added spawner destruction logic
- Ensured destroyed spawners stop spawning permanently

### ✅ Task 5: Save/Load Integration
- Made spawner inherit from `obj_persistent_parent`
- Implemented `serialize()` method to save spawner state
- Implemented `deserialize()` method to restore spawner state
- Integrated with existing room-based save system
- Spawned enemies automatically integrate with existing enemy save system

### ✅ Task 6: Example Child Spawner Objects
Created 4 example spawner types:

1. **obj_spawner_orc_camp** - Finite spawner
   - Spawns exactly 5 orcs then stops
   - Max 2 concurrent enemies
   - Always active, invisible, invulnerable

2. **obj_spawner_bandit_ambush** - Proximity spawner
   - Spawns 6 total enemies (70% burglars, 30% orcs)
   - Activates within 150px of player
   - Max 3 concurrent enemies
   - Visible for testing

3. **obj_spawner_endless_arena** - Continuous spawner
   - Spawns indefinitely
   - Mix of 3 enemy types with weights
   - Max 4 concurrent enemies
   - Invisible, invulnerable

4. **obj_spawner_damageable_nest** - Damageable spawner
   - Continuous spawning until destroyed
   - 20 HP, visible, damageable
   - Max 3 concurrent enemies
   - Spawns burglars

## How to Use

### In GameMaker IDE

1. **Open the project** in GameMaker Studio 2
2. **Find spawner objects** in Asset Browser → Objects → environment
3. **Drag spawners into rooms** to place them
4. **Configure via Instance Creation Code** (optional)

### Using Example Spawners

Simply drag one of the 4 example spawners into your room:
- `obj_spawner_orc_camp` - Quick enemy encounter
- `obj_spawner_bandit_ambush` - Proximity-triggered ambush
- `obj_spawner_endless_arena` - Arena/wave mode
- `obj_spawner_damageable_nest` - Targetable enemy source

### Creating Custom Spawners

**Option 1: Child Object**
```gml
// Create child object inheriting from obj_spawner_parent
// Override in Create event:
event_inherited();

spawn_mode = SpawnerMode.finite;
max_total_spawns = 10;
spawn_table = [
    {enemy_object: obj_orc, weight: 60},
    {enemy_object: obj_burglar, weight: 40}
];
```

**Option 2: Instance Creation Code**
```gml
// Place obj_spawner_parent in room
// Add Instance Creation Code:
spawn_mode = SpawnerMode.continuous;
max_concurrent_enemies = 5;
proximity_enabled = true;
proximity_radius = 200;
is_damageable = true;
hp_total = 30;
```

## Key Features

✅ **Weighted Spawn Tables** - Probabilistic enemy selection
✅ **Two Spawn Modes** - Finite (X enemies) or Continuous (unlimited)
✅ **Enemy Caps** - Limit concurrent alive enemies
✅ **Proximity Activation** - Spawn only when player is near
✅ **Damageable Spawners** - Optional HP and destruction
✅ **Save/Load Persistence** - Full state preservation
✅ **Flexible Configuration** - Override via inheritance or instance
✅ **Spawn Sound Effects** - Optional audio on spawn
✅ **Debug Logging** - Comprehensive console output

## Configuration Reference

### Core Settings
- `spawn_table` - Array of `{enemy_object, weight}` structs
- `spawn_period` - Frames between spawn attempts (60 FPS)
- `spawn_mode` - `SpawnerMode.finite` or `SpawnerMode.continuous`
- `max_total_spawns` - Total enemies to spawn (-1 = unlimited)
- `max_concurrent_enemies` - Max alive enemies at once

### Activation
- `proximity_enabled` - Boolean for proximity activation
- `proximity_radius` - Activation distance in pixels
- `is_active` - Current activation state (auto-managed)

### Appearance & Damage
- `is_visible` - Whether to draw spawner sprite
- `is_damageable` - Whether spawner can take damage
- `hp_total` / `hp_current` - Health values
- `is_destroyed` - Destruction state

### Audio
- `spawn_sound` - Sound asset to play on spawn (or `noone`)

### State (Read-Only)
- `spawned_count` - Total enemies spawned
- `active_spawned_enemies` - Array of alive enemy IDs
- `spawn_timer` - Frames until next spawn

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Place example spawners in test room
- [ ] Test finite spawner stops after limit
- [ ] Test continuous spawner respects enemy cap
- [ ] Test proximity activation/deactivation
- [ ] Test weighted spawn distribution
- [ ] Test damageable spawner destruction
- [ ] Test save/load preserves spawner state
- [ ] Test spawned enemies behave normally
- [ ] Verify destroyed spawners stay destroyed after load

## Debug Tips

### Enable Debug Visualization
Uncomment debug code in `obj_spawner_parent/Draw_0.gml` to show:
- Spawn count and active enemies
- Spawn timer countdown
- Active/inactive status
- Proximity radius circle

### Check Console Output
Spawners log extensive debug messages:
- Creation with configuration summary
- Spawn events with enemy type and count
- Proximity activation/deactivation
- Damage and destruction
- Serialization/deserialization

## Known Limitations

- No sprite assigned to spawners by default (sprite_index = null)
- Visible spawners show as invisible dots unless sprite is assigned
- No visual effects or particles for spawning
- No health bars for damageable spawners
- Spawner state doesn't track individual spawned enemy IDs across save/load

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Spawn effects and particle systems
- Visual health indicators for damageable spawners
- Spawn point offset patterns (circle, line, grid)
- Conditional spawning based on game state
- Spawner chaining and dependencies
- Enemy behavior modifications based on spawner origin

## Conclusion

The enemy spawner system is **complete and ready for use**. All core functionality has been implemented according to spec, including weighted spawning, proximity activation, damage handling, and full save/load integration.

Test the system in GameMaker and provide feedback for any refinements needed!
