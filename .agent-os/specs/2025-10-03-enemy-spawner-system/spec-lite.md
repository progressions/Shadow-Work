# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a configurable enemy spawner system with weighted probability tables, spawn limits, proximity triggers, and customizable behaviors (finite/continuous, visible/invisible, damageable/invulnerable). Spawners will dynamically generate enemies based on configurable rules, respect enemy caps, and persist state across save/load cycles. This enables flexible enemy population management and reduces manual enemy placement across all game levels.
