# Player Save Serialization - Lite Summary

Implement player state serialization as the first phase of rebuilding the save/load system. Save player position, stats, inventory, equipment, quest progress, and recruited companions to JSON files across 5 save slots. Players can save and load their complete game state, restoring character progression and companions.

## Key Points
- Serialize complete player state (position, stats, inventory, equipment, quests, companions) to JSON
- Support 5 independent save slots with metadata (timestamp, playtime, room location)
- Implement save_game() and load_game() functions with slot selection
- Phase 1 focus: Player serialization only (world state deferred to Phase 2)
