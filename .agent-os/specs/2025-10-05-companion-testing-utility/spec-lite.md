# Companion Testing Utility - Lite Summary

Create a quick testing function `quick_recruit_all_companions()` that instantly recruits Hola, Yorna, and Canopy into the player's party, skips their VN intro sequences, and sets all recruitment flags as if they've already been met and recruited. This enables rapid testing of companion-dependent features without playing through the normal recruitment flow.

## Key Points
- Single function call recruits all three companions (Hola, Yorna, Canopy)
- Bypasses VN intro sequences and sets all completion flags
- Initializes default affinity values for immediate testing of party mechanics
