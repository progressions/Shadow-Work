# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement custom Chatterbox functions for Yarn dialogue that query and modify inventory items, check companion affinity levels, and retrieve quest objective progress. Additionally, create a VN content creation skill that guides creators through building companion dialogues, quest conversations, NPC interactions, and environmental VN sequences with proper templates and integration. This enables dynamic dialogue branches based on player state, affinity-gated content unlocking, item trading in conversations, and contextual quest feedback from NPCs.
