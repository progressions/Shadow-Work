# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement `obj_hazard_parent` for environmental hazards that apply damage and/or temporary traits to players and enemies on collision. Hazards support configurable damage types, damage modes (continuous/on-enter), trait application with duration, visual/audio feedback, and integration with existing trait/damage systems. Designers can create varied environmental dangers (fire, poison, ice) through instance variables without custom code for each type.
